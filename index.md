Tetris (–¢–µ—Ç—Ä–∏—Å) is a tile-matching video game created by Russian software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984 for the Electronika 60 computer. 

In this project I have rewritten this nostalgic game in Assembly 8086 language.

### Built With

* [Assembly 8086](https://yjdoc2.github.io/8086-emulator-web/)
* ‚ù§Ô∏è

## How to run

1- Compile the code via [EMU8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/download) to produce .exe file (You can skip this step by using the existing .exe file in Repository's Releases section)

2- Run .exe executable file in [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1) by using commands below:
```
mount [DriveName] [AbsolutePathToEXEFile]
[DriveName]:\
[EXEFile].exe

```
Example:
```
mount C C:\emu8086
C:\
cd MYBUILD
tetris.exe
```

3- Enjoy the game.
